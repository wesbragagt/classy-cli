# classy-cli
A CLI tool for generating typescript types based on your css files.

Imagine a world where writting classNames is as easy as knowing which classes you have available based on your css file.

Just run ```npx classy your-root-css-file```

Now you should see a .ts file in the root of your project with an utility function for passing classNames that are available in your css file.
